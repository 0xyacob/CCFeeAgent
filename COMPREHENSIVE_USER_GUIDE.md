## Fee Calculation Methodology

### Calculation Framework Overview
The system implements a sophisticated fee calculation engine that handles multiple investment scenarios while maintaining regulatory compliance and mathematical accuracy.

### Investment Type Classifications

#### Gross Investment Calculations
**Definition**: Investment amount where fees are additional to the specified amount.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Total Transfer = Base Investment + (Base Investment × Fee Percentage) + VAT
```

#### Net Investment Calculations
**Definition**: Investment amount where fees are deducted from the total amount.

**Calculation Method**:
1. **Total Amount**: Specified amount includes fees
2. **Fee Extraction**: Fees calculated backwards from total
3. **Net Investment**: Amount remaining after fee deduction
4. **VAT Handling**: VAT included in fee calculations

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Net Investment = Total Amount ÷ (1 + Fee Percentage + VAT Rate)
```
